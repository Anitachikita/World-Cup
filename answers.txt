Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As we increase the number of simulations the prediction becomes more accurate.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I think 10000 simulations is "good enough".
